# Project-1

- This project is intended on helping people determine the full cost of a road trip and split the price with their friends.

- The idea is to choose an event that you wish to attend.

- To use the tool you first need to select the city for the event. For now, only the 3 main cities are avaliable (Mexico City, Monterrey, Guadalajara), 

- Then select your date, starting point and the number of people going on the road trip.

- After this you can choose the events listed below the map and click in the hotel you wish to stay. 

- When you finish you should see the full price displayed, this price includes tolls, fuel, hotel and tickets.
